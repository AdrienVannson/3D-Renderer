# 3D-Renderer

3D-Renderer is a 3D renderer that uses the ray-tracing algorithm in order to create 2D pictures of 3D models.
It can simulate color, luminosity, shadows and even mirrors!

3D-Renderer is entirely written in C++. It relies on Qt to display the generated pictures and to open or create files.
It can open and render any .obj file, provided that the objects are triangulated beforehand.

## Examples
